# Swing to JavaFX


## Toughest part of the project
- The key parts of this tough part of the project included setting up JavaFX inside of IntelliJ, replacing
the existing animation function with AnimationTimer from JavaFX.
- MusicPlayer had to be replaced with JavaFXs Media Player, which required a dependency in the pom.xml file.

## Post translation
- After this lengthy process was finished, I was then able to start thinking about which additions I would implement.
