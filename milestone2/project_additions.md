# Project Additions

## Menu Start Screen and Death Screen
- Added a menu screen such that the user can now enter their name, ([see Leaderboard](#leaderboard)), set an 
ambient color profile that matches the game background.

## Game options: pause and exit
- Implemented a pause and exit/home button, using PauseController and ExitController respectively. 

## Leaderboard
- When user loads in they are greeted with the menu view that holds a leaderboard, which displays the 
top 5 scores ever played.

## Blockades
- My addition of blockades makes the game more fun and challenging, as the player now has moving and live 'opponents' 
that they must escape, adding another layer of complexity and challenge to the game.

## Additional Level
- My introduction of another level also changes the game. The more difficult level, <i>Level 2013</i>, has an extra 
blockade/opponent which makes the game more difficult, and features a new location displayed through a new scene.
