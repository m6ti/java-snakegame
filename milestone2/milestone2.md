# Milestone 2

## [Structure Update](./structure_update.md)

First things first, updating the project's source code structure is a great place to start.

## [MVC Implementation](./mvc_implementation.md)

The next step along the way is to implement the MVC (Model, View, Controller) Pattern. 

## [Swing to JavaFX](./swing_to_javafx.md)

After this, we must replace Swing with JavaFX.

## [Project Additions](./project_additions.md)

Now that Swing has been fully replaced with JavaFX, we can start adding to the project!
I'm thinking a menu, customisation, better controls, and extra levels!

## Post Milestone 2

I have made significant changes to the source code, and have ensured that post development,
It is easy to add to and change, because of its modularity and good use of encapsulation.
So, if in the near future, I happen to want to add to the snake game, I can
do so with minimum effort, and enjoy the process ðŸ˜€.
