# Milestone 1

## Flow Analysis

- We launch the snake game through play.java.
- When we run the file, we instantiate a new Play object.
- After instantiation, a few key *instance variables* are created, namely mySnake : MySnake, food : Food, background : Image, fail : Image.
- This Play class also overrides a couple methods from its parent class, MyFrame: keyPressed() and paint().
- A novel method is also created called drawScore().
