# Milestone 1

## [Class Analysis](class_analysis.md)

This page aims to analyse the seperate classes, by examining how they interact and behave. 

## Post Milestone 1...
- Here is what I plan to after this first milestone:
  - Rename of certain classes and attributes so that they are more concise and clear.
  - Restructuring the project. Need to make certain classes into separate files, and aggregate 
  and group similar files together.
  - Implementation of the MVC model for readability and maintainability.

For the next part of my project, [visit **Milestone 2**](../milestone2/milestone2.md).

Alternatively, [go back to **project home**](../README.md).
