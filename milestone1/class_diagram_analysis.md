# Class Analysis


## Automatically Generated Class Diagram
![Auto-Generated Class Diagram](../resources/AutoGeneratedClassDiagram.jpg)
- The automatically generated class diagram fails to capture some of the important relationships that the classes have.
  Below is my final class diagram that I have created based on the source code.

## My Class Diagram
![Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.4.jpg)
- The greatest difference between my class diagram and the auto-generated one, is the existence
of relationship of aggregation between `ImageUtil` and `GameUtil`. Also, `play` has many dependencies 
on different classes such as `Food`, `MusicPlayer`, `MySnake`, and `ImageUtil`.


# Class Diagram History

## Class Diagram 1.0
![First Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.0.jpg)
- This was my initial class diagram that I produced. As you can see it grasps the fundamentals of how 
the program works, but lacks some key relationships, and even the interface!

## Class Diagram 1.1
![Second Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.1.jpg)
- My second version of the class diagram that I produced. This version includes the inner class relationships.

## Class Diagram 1.2
![Third Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.2.jpg)
- This class diagram matches the layout of the one that was auto-generated, as well as implementing the interface.

## Class Diagram 1.3
![Fourth Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.3.jpg)
- Addition of `<<use>>` tags.

## Class Diagram 1.4 
![Fifth Class Diagram](../resources/ClassDiagram1.4.jpg)
- Updated the relationships based on new understanding of the relationships between the classes.
