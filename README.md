## Overview

This repository is for my COMP2013 Snake Game project refactored and added to by myself, psymk6. The project involves
refactoring a classic Snake game, updating the game logic, and providing an enjoyable gaming experience. 

This README provides links to essential information about my progression through the project and my achievements.

## [Getting Started](./milestone1/milestone1.md)

To get to grips with the code, I have decided to meticulously inspect each class within the source code.
